I created a GAN neural network to generate Holiday images at 256x256 resolution.  The results of this training are contained in the Git repository.  Other resources:

You can use this notebook to generate images useing a prebuilt GAN that I created. A GPU is required, this notebook is designed to work with Google CoLab. This notebook only deals with running the GAN to produce images.
